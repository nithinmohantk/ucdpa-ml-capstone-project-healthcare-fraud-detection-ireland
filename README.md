## 🌟 Introduction

This project analyses healthcare claims data to identify potential **fraud** patterns. Using synthetic datasets generated via **Synthea**, we perform exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, anomaly detection, and visualization to uncover suspicious behaviors from patient, provider, and claims perspectives.

### 🏥 About Healthcare Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA)  
Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) in healthcare represent significant challenges worldwide, leading to billions of euros in unnecessary costs annually. Specifically, in Ireland and across the European Union, healthcare systems are under increasing pressure to optimize resources while maintaining high standards of care.

- **Fraud** involves intentional deception or misrepresentation for financial gain, such as falsifying claims or identities.  
- **Waste** refers to overutilization or inefficient practices that increase costs without improving patient outcomes.  
- **Abuse** includes practices like upcoding, billing for services not rendered, or unbundling procedures to inflate charges.

> **Note:**  
> The scope of this project is to focus on detecting fraudulent activity or suspicious relationships between healthcare actors such as providers, patients, pharmacies.  

### 💡 Why does this matter?  

- According to the European Healthcare Fraud and Corruption Network (EHFCN), EU member states lose an estimated **€56 billion annually** due to healthcare fraud and abuse. [Source](https://www.ehfcn.eu/)  
- In Ireland, the Health Service Executive (HSE) estimates that **up to 10%** of healthcare expenditure may be attributable to fraud, waste, or abuse, translating into hundreds of millions of euros annually.  
- The **World Bank** reports that health sector fraud costs can account for **up to 3-5%** of total health expenditures in developed countries.

Effective fraud detection helps prevent financial losses, addresses inefficiencies and compliance risks, and rises in the cost of care. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify suspicious claims and activities in synthetic Irish healthcare data.

## 🔬 Analysis & Techniques for FWA Detection
### 1. Understanding FWA Concepts
| Concept | Explanation | Indicator | Formula / Metric | Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Fraud** ✅ | Intentional deception for financial gain | Claims with false info or staging | False claims, identity theft | Excessive claims, suspicious patterns |
| **Waste** 🚫 | Overutilization or misuse of resources | Excessive billing, unnecessary procedures | Cost per patient/provider | High expenses with no added value |
| **Abuse** 🚫 | Improper billing practices | Upcoding, unbundling | Billing codes misuse | Discrepancies between services and codes |

### 2. Techniques & Code
- **Outlier Detection** (e.g., Isolation Forest)  
  - **Purpose:** Automatically flag claims that deviate significantly from normal patterns.  
  - **Formula / Concept:** Isolation Forest isolates anomalies by randomly partitioning the data space. Fewer splits to isolate a point suggest an anomaly.  
  - **Interpretation:** Claims flagged as -1 are potential frauds or anomalies needing manual review.  
- **Threshold-based Flagging:**  
  - **Purpose:** Identifies claims exceeding set thresholds for amount or frequency, that would require potential review.   
- **Visualization & Network Analysis:**  
  - **Purpose:** This reveals clusters of suspicious providers and patients, that would require potential review.

### 📊 Datasets
This project utilizes a **synthetic healthcare dataset** generated through the **Synthea** tool. Synthea is an open-source simulator designed to produce realistic, anonymized patient records based on population models. This approach enables scalable and privacy-preserving research and analysis. Synthea generates wide set of datasets specific to whole heatlhcare domain context out of which we are only using claims.csv, claim_transactions.csv, providers.csv, patients.csv etc, rest of the files are moved from the github repository to avoid excessive storage billing. 

> **INFO:**  
> Due to limited and insufficient data available from HSE and broader European sources, we opted to use synthetic data generated via Synthea. This allows us to create a comprehensive, realistic dataset that includes diverse patient profiles, claims, and healthcare scenarios necessary for effective fraud detection analysis. Using synthetic data ensures data privacy, enables scalable testing, and provides the detailed information required to develop and validate robust fraud detection models in a controlled environment.

#### Why Use Synthetic Data?

- **Privacy & Confidentiality:** Synthetic data circumvents privacy concerns associated with real patient records.
- **Controlled Environment:** Facilitates testing, experimentation, and validation without risking sensitive information.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Eliminates the need for complex data access procedures and compliance hurdles.
- **Customizability:** Data can be tailored to specific scenarios, demographic distributions, or rare conditions, enhancing research flexibility.

The datasets used include:

- **Patients Data (patients.csv):** Demographics, medical history, and socioeconomic info.
- **Claims Data (claims.csv):** Claims details such as amount, date, diagnoses, and provider.
- **Claims Transactions (claims_transactions.csv):** Detailed transaction info linked to claims.
- **Providers Data (providers.csv):** Provider specialties, locations, and contact info.

The datasets are synthetically generated and stored in CSV format, providing a realistic basis for analysis.

The datasets are stored in the following directory structure (within the repo):

```
data/
└── sample_data/
    └── csv/
        └── [county-specific folders]/
            └── *.csv
```
> Each folder contains CSV files specific to a county. (for e.g: galway, limerick, dublin, cork) 

> **Warning:**
Using Synthea-generated synthetic datasets enables safe and flexible healthcare data analysis. However, it is crucial to understand and account for the inherent biases to ensure meaningful and responsible insights.

## Analysis Workflow 🔍

Here we are trying to document the few high level steps involved in processing the data. 

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

```bash
import pandas as pd

patients_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/patients.csv')
claims_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/claims.csv')
transactions_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/claims_transactions.csv')
providers_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/providers.csv')

# Convert date columns to datetime
patients_df['BIRTHDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(patients_df['BIRTHDATE'], errors='coerce')
claims_df['SERVICEDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(claims_df['SERVICEDATE'], errors='coerce')
transactions_df['FROMDATE'] = pd.to_datetime(transactions_df['FROMDATE'], errors='coerce')
transactions_df['TODATE'] = pd.to_datetime(transactions_df['TODATE'], errors='coerce')
```

### Data Merging

```bash
    # Merge
    merged_df = claims_df.merge(transactions_df, on='CLAIMID', how='left')
```


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 1. Patients Demographics
##### 1.1 Distribution of Gender
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.countplot(data=patients_df, x='GENDER')
plt.title('Patient Gender Distribution')
plt.show()
```

##### 1.2 Age Calculation
```python
import datetime as dt
today = dt.date.today()
patients_df['AGE'] = patients_df['BIRTHDATE'].apply(lambda x: today.year - x.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (x.month, x.day)))
sns.histplot(patients_df['AGE'], bins=20)
plt.title('Patient Age Distribution')
plt.show()
```
##### 1.3 Claims Overview

```python
# Claim amount distribution
sns.boxplot(x=merged_df['AMOUNT'])
plt.title('Claim Amounts')
plt.show()

# Claims over Time
merged_df['SERVICEDATE'].hist(bins=30)
plt.title('Claims Over Time')
plt.show()
```

#### 1.4 Provider Analysis

```python
# Top providers by number of claims
provider_claim_counts = merged_df['PROVIDERID'].value_counts().head(10)
provider_claim_counts.plot(kind='bar')
plt.ylabel('Number of Claims')
plt.title('Top 10 Providers by Claim Count')
plt.show()
```

### Feature Engineering & Suspicious Pattern Detection


##### 1. Identify High-Value Claims

```python
high_claim_threshold = merged_df['AMOUNT'].quantile(0.99)
suspicious_claims = merged_df[merged_df['AMOUNT'] > high_claim_threshold]
```

##### 2. Detect Repetitive & Rapid Claims
```python
merged_df['DATE'] = merged_df['SERVICEDATE'].dt.date
claims_per_provider_day = claims_df.groupby(['PROVIDERID', 'DATE']).size()
suspicious_frequency = claims_per_provider_day[claims_per_provider_day > 10]
```
##### 3. Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Prepare features
features = merged_df[['AMOUNT']]
features.fillna(0, inplace=True

clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01, random_state=42)
merged_df['anomaly_score'] = clf.fit_predict(features)

# Filter suspected fraudulent claims
suspects = merged_df[merged_df['anomaly_score'] == -1]
```
#### Visualization of Suspicious Activities

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.Graph()
for _, row in suspects.iterrows():
    G.add_node(row['PROVIDERID'], type='provider')
    G.add_node(row['PATIENTID'], type='patient')
    G.add_edge(row['PROVIDERID'], row['PATIENTID'])

nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.title('Suspected Provider-Patient Network')
plt.show()
```

### 💡 Concepts and Techniques Used

The analysis techniques implemented are specifically designed to identify fraudulent activities within healthcare claims:

- **Suspicious Claim Amounts:** Flagging claims with abnormally high amounts or units that are unlikely to be legitimate.
- **Unusual Claim Frequency:** Detecting providers or patients with an unusually high number of claims, indicating potential overutilization or collusive behavior.
- **Suspicious Service Codes:** Identifying claims associated with known or potentially fraudulent procedure codes.
- **Rapid Claim Submissions:** Highlighting providers submitting multiple claims within short timeframes, a pattern often associated with fraud rings.
- **Anomaly Scores from Machine Learning:** Utilizing algorithms like Isolation Forest and Random Forest to detect claims that significantly deviate from standard patterns, flagging them as potential fraud cases.
- **Network and Graph Analysis:** Revealing organized collusion or fraud rings by visualizing suspicious provider-patient relationships.

These methods collectively enhance the ability to detect, prioritize, and investigate fraudulent activities efficiently, helping to reduce financial losses and protect the integrity of healthcare systems.

### 📝 Findings & Next Steps
> High claim amounts and frequent claims flagged as potential fraud.

> Outlier claims identified via anomaly detection.

> Network analysis reveals clusters of providers and patients with suspicious interactions.

> Next steps include integrating supervised learning models with labeled data, refining feature sets, and developing dashboards for ongoing monitoring.

### 🎯 Final Notes
> This analysis serves as an initial screening tool.

> False positives are possible; manual review is essential.

> Models should be continuously updated with new data and feedback.
